# Image Processing and Analysis

This repository contains various Image processing concepts related to image filtering, image adjustments, etc. The concepts are illustrated using MATLAB software and OpenCV where ever possible.

Refernces for this repository are:

1. Digital Image Processing with MATLAB,<i> Second Edition </i> **by Rafael Gonsalves and Richard Woods**
2. Learning OpenCV3 <i> Computer Vision in C++ with OpenCV Library </i> **by Adrian Kaehler & Gary Bradski**

Version of Software: MATLAB (2019b) and OpenCV. <b> Both the software running on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS </b> 

All the folders shall contain a README file and the output image result of that concept.

In this repository we shall be dealing with following types of Images:

1. Gray Scale Image 
2. Binary Image 
3. Indexed Images 
4. RGB Images (Coloured Image Processing)
5. Filtering of Images

Note: All the Test Images have been in the file along with the source code incase want to change please do so by giving the path Image or Image name but make sure that code is able to find the images properly.
