## Intensity Transformation

Defination of Intensity: An image is defined as a two-dimensional function f(x, y) the amplitude of f at any pair of coordinates (x, y) is called the intensity or gray level of the image at that point.

Intensity images have a pixel value ranging between [0,1] where 0 represents a black and 1 represents a white image. All the values between them are shades of grey/ white thus, the name is derived as intensity/ gray level images. 

The Figure illustrates the concept of intensity images
